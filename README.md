# Random number generator done using ReactJS

This is a simple random number generator done using ReactJS for the purpose of technical test.
It demonstrates the use of ReactJS to build amd run the application.

## Prerequisites

- Node (npm > 10.5)

## Getting Started

### Installing dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```sh
npm install
```

### Building the Project

To build the project using npm, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```
## Run application

To run the application locally, run the following command:

### Running Unit Tests

To execute the unit tests included with the project, use the following Maven command:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Improvements

### Code improvements
- Third party libraries can be used for generating random number (eg: https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom)
  - Using this, we can make sure the random numbers are crypto-secure
  - And they are not very easily predictable random numbers
- Unit testing to be improved with more coverage

### UI improvements
- More styling can be applied using tailwindcss, material-ui etc.,
- Layouts can be added to the page (useful when multiple pages are to be added)
- Allow user to choose one or two lucky numbers for draw
